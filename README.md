# Screw all of this.

After doing more research I have determined Vim sucks and even with all of the hotkeys and tools installed it will never hold a candle to VSCode or PyCharm when it comes to writing real code.

nvim and vim are great for making quick changes but for the love of god just install nvim and customize your hotkeys don't install packages expecting to make it an editor.

Run the setup command with sudo and it should automatically pull down
the given packages and set everything up.

Although you will have to start up nvim afterwards and run 

`:Pluginstall`
